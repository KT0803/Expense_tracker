## 3. Problem Statement
Many students, professionals, and families struggle to manage their day-to-day expenses effectively. Most people rely on manual methods like notebooks, spreadsheets, or memory, which leads to poor financial planning and overspending. Existing expense tracking apps are often cluttered with unnecessary features, lack offline support, or require a subscription. There is a clear need for a simple, intuitive, and mobile-first solution that helps users track, categorize, and analyze their expenses in real time.

## 4. Proposed Solution / Idea
SmartExpense is a cross-platform mobile app designed to simplify daily financial management. The app will allow users to log expenses and income manually, categorize transactions, and visualize their spending patterns through an intuitive dashboard. A key feature will be smart categorization using AI — the app will suggest categories (e.g., Food, Travel, Bills) based on past entries and transaction keywords. The app will also include budget-setting features and alerts to help users stay within limits.

## 5. Key Features
- **Quick Add Transactions:** Simple interface to log income or expense in under 5 seconds.  
- **Smart Categorization:** AI-powered suggestions for transaction categories (Food, Transport, Utilities, etc.).  
- **Budget Management:** Set monthly/weekly budgets and get alerts when nearing the limit.  
- **Real-Time Dashboard:** Visual charts showing spending breakdowns, savings trends, and category-wise distribution.  
- **Export & Backup:** Export expense reports in PDF/CSV and enable cloud backup with Firebase.  
- **Dark Mode & Offline Mode:** Accessibility-friendly features ensuring smooth usage without internet.  

## 6. Target Users / Audience
- College students managing limited pocket money.  
- Working professionals wanting to budget monthly expenses.  
- Families tracking household spending.  
- Freelancers managing personal and work-related expenses.  

## 7. Technology Stack
- **Mobile Framework:** React Native (cross-platform for Android & iOS)  
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js  
- **Database:** Firebase Firestore (or MongoDB)  
- **AI/ML:** TensorFlow Lite or ML Kit for smart categorization  
- **Authentication & Cloud:** Firebase Authentication + Firebase Cloud Storage  
- **Deployment:** Google Play Store & Apple App Store  

## 8. Expected Outcome
The final output will be a mobile application that enables users to effortlessly track and categorize their expenses. SmartExpense should allow users to log a transaction in under 5 seconds, provide category suggestions with at least 90% accuracy, and display real-time financial insights through visual dashboards. Users will gain better control over their finances and improve budgeting habits.
